Description: Workaround to pull Qt Wayland QPA dynamically - no-qt package
 Droidian is currently a mostly-GTK+ distro, so we try to avoid
 foreign dependencies if not strictly needed.
 This has the side effect that, when Qt applications are installed, no
 working backend is put in place (since applications don't depend on any),
 resulting in a worsened end-user experience.
 .
 This package works around this by getting installed by default on image
 creation (due to how APT works), and will be automatically replaced
 by droidian-qt whenever an end-user wants to install a Qt application.
